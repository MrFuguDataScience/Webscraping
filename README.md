# Webscraping: with `Beautiful Soup4` | `Regex` | `Selenium` | `Py4J` | `Eclipse IDE with Maven`
**This is a two part jupyter notebook**

This exercise was used to find what countries voted: `for/against/abstained` for any given `Resolution`from the United Nations

+ First part of this project: Find all webpages relevant to `Session Resolutions`, this was entails entering 3 pages deep.
  * Second part deals with parsing `online pdf` files with `Java PDFBox` and sending that data to `Python` with `Py4J`.
    * From there we will finially parse with `Regex` these files which will be plain text for our: voting by country
