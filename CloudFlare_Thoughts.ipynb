    "\n",
    "*Basic understaning* of how `Cloudflare` operates: \n",
    "\n",
    "`--------------------------------------`\n",
    "\n",
    "They are a cyber security and content delivery network. Because of this you are at a disposition as a webscraper because you are not spared from their wrath. Using `Selenium WebDriver` is a warning beacon making your presence known. `CloudFlare` uses *active* and *passive* detecting measures to counter any perceived threat.\n",
    "\n",
    "*They utilize*:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ *`Active` monitoring:* CAPTCHA, event tracking, (canvas) fingerprinting to name a few\n",
    "+ *`Passive` monioring:* HTTP headers, TLS finger printing, checking your IP adress reputation, among many others\n",
    "+ May imploy behavior techniques such as *mouse movements*\n",
    "+ *JavaScript Challenges*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to mention a few important tasks that may occur when using this platform when you are using `automation or test software`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example when you are trying to webscrape there are signatures that are looked for to determine your behavior and finger print.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ When you use `Selenium` you have what is called a `WebDriver` that is used to connect a browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Mozilla, etc to that server through requests.\n",
    "    + By default `Selenium` will send information to the website letting it know you are using active test-autiomation software. This trigger can directly get you into a hiccup with the server. Yes, you can mask this by turning off the ping but, it is not fool proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Other behaviors can trigger this as well:*\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ When you try to connect to a server; information about you is given to them such as:\n",
    "    + what version of browser, what type of browser you are on, screen resolution, mouse movements, timing of your responses like clicks and moving to new pages quickly, geo-location, IP address.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Think of it like this*: we are creating an active digital finger print. This finger print consists of various markers that make the site able to detect who we are. Because of this you have to consider that sites can evaluate your IP Address as credible or potentially a bot (like a credit system) and they hold the keys to let you pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If you want to obscure your presence and fly under the radar it is imperative to include various steps in your process to roam around without raising suspicion. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations:** to help in your epic learning experience as a data extracting boss (ethically of course...)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) **`IP Blocking/Tracking`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your IP Address can be a red flag to these sites. Remember they have options such as throttling your requests, limiting data shown to you or even block you out right. If you are suspected to have a past of making a ton of requests, acting malicious or against terms of service this may persist into issues even into the future. I was blocked from Indeed webscraping twice with 3 different IP address in 2 different countries which persisted for around 9-12 months. Your geographic location can pose an issue as well because this may even restrict your access or the content you see. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Solution:`** you will need to use rotating proxy services to obscure your IP address and utilize theirs. VPN networks and TOR can have issues that will not resolve themselves and cannot guarantee results.\n",
    "\n",
    "`-------------------------------------------------------------`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) **`User Agent`**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`-------------------------------------------------------------`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) **`Java Script Challenge`** \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sneaky little technique checking to see if you are legit or not. They will send you a piece of `Java Script` code and the issue is that most automation tools cannot answer the request because it doesn't render. This is how they catch you, think of Dave Chappelle in his famous line: \"Gottcha ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`-------------------------------------------------------------`\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) **`Timing Requests`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`-------------------------------------------------------------`\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) **`Python & Selenium are telling on you!`**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The `header` from Python can give away information that you are using automation software! Selenium notifies that you are are using automation software making things difficult for you as well (but these can be managed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please Selenium & Python help me out and be quiet. Really this is supposed to be a good thing in practice but webscraping its like your neighbor telling the HOA you didn't remove a single weed from the grass. Yeah, true story. An HOA is there to help provide order but, in the end they do more harm than good.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** consider turning of notifcations from Selenium showing that you are using automation software tools. With regard to Python we need to consider options for the header such as headless browser but this poses other issues I will mention.\n",
    "\n",
    "`-------------------------------------------------------------`\n",
    "\n",
    "6.) **`TLS Finger Printing:`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`TLS:` **T**ransport **L**ayer **S**ecurity, can be considered a handshake between you the client and the server. Information is exchanged to make sure you are legit, the communication is encrypted and each client will have their own signature (finger print). The information provided in your finger print dictates if it is a casual user or automated tools such as bots or scrapers. In general a request from a browser will be different from a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ex.) `import httpx`\n",
    "\n",
    "ex.) [Java Selenium Finger printing](https://github.com/CheshireCaat/selenium-with-fingerprints)\n",
    "\n",
    "`-------------------------------------------------------------`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you are using `open source software to avoid detection`, underatnd `CloudFlare` can also use this software to know how it works and fix vulnerabilities. Therfore, these technique may aid you for some services you encounter but, if you deal with advanced more guarded servers than you will be detected!\n",
    "\n",
    "`-------------------------------------------------------------`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can handle these issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ User Agent Rotation: Changes the user agent to mimic different browsers and devices.\n",
    "+ Delays: Introduces random delays to avoid detection based on timing patterns.\n",
    "+ Handling Cloudflare: Cloudflare’s JavaScript challenges can be difficult to bypass with automation. Rotating IP addresses and using CAPTCHA-solving services might be necessary."
